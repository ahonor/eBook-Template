{"name":"Ebook-template","tagline":"Template to create PDF, ePub and Kindle books with Asciidoc and dblatex","body":"Template for Writing an eBook\r\n=============================\r\n\r\nThis project contains a template used to write eBooks using\r\n[AsciiDoc][1], Git, and any plain text editor in Mac OS X.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the project is to provide a boilerplate used to generate\r\neBooks in several formats on one operation:\r\n\r\n- Self-contained HTML\r\n- ePub\r\n- PDF\r\n- Kindle\r\n\r\nMotivation\r\n----------\r\n\r\nWhy using such a complex setup instead of just using a simpler tool like\r\nWord or Pages?\r\n\r\n- The primary motivation of this template is versioning. Being able to\r\n  use plain text files as input for the book brings the possibility of\r\n  versioning each change individually using Git, Subversion or any other\r\n  similar tool. This also opens up the door to collaboration among team\r\n  members when editing a document.\r\n- The second motivation is to separate the presentation and the layout\r\n  of the final book from its contents. Other output file types could be\r\n  added in the future.\r\n- This also brings the possibility of using any text editor in just\r\n  about any operating system; files are just plain text files that can\r\n  be edited with gEdit, Notepad, Emacs, Vim, TextEdit, or any other\r\n  similar tool.\r\n- Markup languages like Markdown or Asciidoc (used in this template) are\r\n  simpler and more readable than LaTeX or other SGML-like languages,\r\n  making the files readable and lean even when edited in a text editor\r\n  without any syntax highlighting or formatting support.\r\n- Finally, being able to streamline the creation of the three versions\r\n  of the book in just one command-line operation allows the whole setup\r\n  to be automatized.\r\n\r\nHow it Works\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThe `master.asciidoc` file at the root of this project provides the\r\nguiding structure of the book. Chapters can be shuffled around,\r\nindependently of their contents or internal structure.\r\n\r\nIndividual chapters are stored in the `chapters` folder, one file per\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nImages are stored as PNG files in the `images` folder.\r\n\r\nThe Makefile creates a temporary `_build` folder, copies all the\r\ndifferent elements in it (the master file, the chapters and the images)\r\nand commands the execution of the whole toolchain in order to get the\r\nfinal result.\r\n\r\nSoftware Requirements\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nFollow these instructions to install the required libraries in Mac OS X:\r\n\r\n1. Install [Homebrew][2] if not already installed.\r\n    - If already installed, remember to run `brew update; brew upgrade`.\r\n2. Download and install `asciidoc` using Homebrew:\r\n    - `brew install asciidoc`\r\n3. Install source-highlight with Homebrew (this will install Boost \r\n   as a dependency):\r\n    - `brew install source-highlight`\r\n4. Install the `dblatex` package with Homebrew:\r\n    - `brew install dblatex`\r\n5. If the above command does not work, follow the instructions here:\r\n   `https://gist.github.com/dustinschultz/6554087`\r\n6. Download the [kindlegen][3] tool and install it in the following\r\n   path:\r\n    - `/Applications/KindleGen_Mac_i386_v2_7/kindlegen`\r\n\r\nHow to build the book \r\n---------------------\r\n\r\n1. Make sure AsciiDoc and dblatex are properly installed.\r\n2. Execute the `make` command. This will create the PDF, ePub and HTML\r\n   versions of the book.\r\n3. `make pdf`, `make html`, `make epub` and `make kindle` each generate\r\n   the specified version of the booklet.\r\n4. `make clean` removes the `_build` folder.\r\n\r\nThe .mobi (Amazon Kindle) version requires the [kindlegen][3] tool.\r\n\r\nAfter the build process completes, the compiled eBooks will be available\r\nat the `_build` subfolder.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nSee the LICENSE.md file.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]:http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/\r\n[2]:http://brew.sh\r\n[3]:http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1000234621\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
